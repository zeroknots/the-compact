 * @title The Compact â€” Core Interface
 * @custom:version 0 (early-stage proof-of-concept)
 * @author 0age (0age.eth)
 * @notice The Compact is an ownerless ERC6909 contract that facilitates the voluntary
 * formation and mediation of reusable "resource locks." This interface contract specifies
 * external functions for making deposits, for performing allocated transfers and
 * withdrawals, for initiating and performing forced withdrawals, and for registering
 * compact claim hashes and typehashes directly. It also contains methods for registering
 * allocators and for enabling allocators to consume nonces directly. Finally, it specifies
 * a number of view functions, events and errors.
