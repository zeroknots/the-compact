/**
 * @title EmissaryLogic
 * @notice Logic that provides functionality for delegating signature verification
 * @dev This contract enables accounts to delegate signature verification to another address,
 *      which is particularly important for maintaining credible commitments in TheCompact ecosystem.
 *
 * When EOAs upgrade to smart accounts (as enabled by EIP-7702), their signature
 * verification method potentially changes from ECDSA to ERC1271. This creates a potential issue
 * where an EOA could use EIP-7702 to redelegate to a new account implementation and break previously
 * established credible commitments.
 *
 * EmissaryLogic introduces a delegation mechanism where signature verification can be
 * delegated to an external contract that verifies claim hashes on behalf of the sponsor.
 * This creates more reliable credible commitments by ensuring signature verification
 * remains consistent even if the account implementation changes.
 *
 * A timelock mechanism is implemented to prevent immediate changes to emissaries,
 * providing additional security against malicious redelegation attempts.
 * The contract provides functions to schedule and assign emissaries, as well as
 * get the current status of an emissary assignment.
